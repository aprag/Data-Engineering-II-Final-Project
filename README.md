Project Summary

As a part of the curriculum of the Master 2 (M2) course entitled “Data Engineering II”, the students
will complete a team project work. Each team is composed of 3 members, and the members will take
care of dividing the tasks equally between them. The purpose of this project is to combine all the
skills collected throughout the entire course, and to provide a solid example of real-life application
development in a DevOps environment.

The following sections provide necessary information about the description of the application to be
created.
